            <h3>I've been to</h3>
            <h1>Toulouse, France</h1>
            <p>September 2023, I took a trip to Toulouse, France. I was a volunteer for the Rugby World Cup with one of my close friends. It was a memorable trip, lots of fun memories and some new friends. We ate a lot of baguettes, we tried the local dish cassoulet, we tried some local wine and lots more. We visited lots of museums and parks which were located in or near the city. One really memorable museum was the space museum because it actually had a life-sized rocket. We met a lot of people from different countries including of course France, Spain, Germany, Portugal and Italy and overall, it was a very fulfilling trip.</p>

            <h3>I've been to</h3>
            <h1>Barcelona, Spain</h1>
            <p>While we were in France, me and my friend took a little vacation from the vacation to Barcelona. After a short bus ride, we spent 3 days in Barcelona making the most of it. We saw the Sagrada de Familia, Gaudi Park, Moco Museum, the Beso wall and lots more. We tried some Spanish food like the Paelja, churros, street snacks etc. For only 3 days we tried to get the best experience of the Spanish culture. </p>

            <h3>I've been to</h3>
            <h1>Naples, Italy</h1>
            <p>In Italy I was situated in Naples. It was everything you could imagine Italy to be like, everyone was driving a vespa or fiat and on every corner there was a pizza place. I had lots of time to explore the city and get the most of it, I visited the most beautiful gardens and museums I have ever been to and I even made a day trip to Pompeii. Every night I ate a small pizza, and every other day I ate the most delicious pasta. This trip was a memorable one because it made me want to see every part of Italy.</p>
